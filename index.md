My name is George, I love all things cyber.

I split my time between trying to peer into the matrix over a keyboard and
banging my head on it. My professional achievements include harassing people on
twitter, causing inter-organisation incidents, and upsetting management at
Christmas parties.

I like to learn new things, and this site documents some of the things that I
couldn't readily find elsewhere. I hope you find it useful!

I have accounts on the website formerly known as
[Twitter](https://x.com/icantcomputer) and
[github](https://github.com/it-cant-computer). Feel free to say 'hi'.

You can find a list of articles I've written below.
